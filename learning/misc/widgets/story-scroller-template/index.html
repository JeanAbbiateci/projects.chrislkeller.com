<p>More than 360 children died of abuse or neglect-related injuries in Indiana between July 1, 2002, and June 30, 2008, Department of Child Services records show.</p> About 29.5 percent of those children died despite prior contact with the child protection agency.</p>

<p>Anthony's uncle, Nick Szany, was one of the last to contact child services, forwarding a DCS employee a letter he'd written about the suspected abuse, an e-mail dated Sept. 22, 2008, shows. The e-mail was provided to The Times by the family.</p>
<p>"Is today the day (Anthony) gets another fractured skull, or maybe another leg injury that makes him limp for three weeks again?" Nick Szany wrote in the e-mail. "Why do you find the need to beat your child, and ignore him when he needs you the most? ... Every day is another day I am scared for a child that will be lucky to see the age of five."</p>

<strong>Unraveling the truth</strong>
<p>DCS investigators and Lowell police interviewed Anthony's extended family and pediatrician after his death to determine what went wrong.</p>
<p>It was only after Anthony died that the family fully admitted seeing Anthony's bruises and other injuries. His doctor, John, said there could have been reasons other than abuse for the toddler's earlier injuries.</p>
<p>DCS investigators concluded both Gilman and Alycia Szany were responsible for Anthony's death.</p>
<p>Investigators substantiated abuse on Gilman's part for Anthony's multiple internal and external injuries and neglect for endangering Anthony's life and health, DCS records show. The toddler's death was due to physical abuse, records state.</p>
<p>DCS also found Alycia Szany partially responsible for her son's death. The state agency substantiated neglect by Szany for endangering Anthony's life and health. Her neglect also was part of the reason for his death, DCS records state.</p>
<p>But Alycia Szany has not been charged criminally for Anthony's death.</p>

<strong>Lessons learned</strong>
<p>There is no guarantee Anthony would have lived if his family and doctor had spoken up earlier.</p>
<p>But DCS officials say circumstances like those in Anthony's case hamper DCS' efforts to ensure a child's well-being.</p>
<p>DCS spokeswoman Ann Houseworth said the reluctance of family, friends, neighbors, school teachers and others to notify authorities is a common problem.</p>
<p>"I think it's just very important for neighbors and friends and family members and citizens to realize their role in child protection," Houseworth said. "And while it is our charge (to protect children) as employees of the state working for the department, it is the responsibility of all citizens."</p>

p>Indiana is a universal mandatory reporting state, meaning everyone is responsible for reporting any alleged abuse or neglect.</p>
